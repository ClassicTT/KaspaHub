<article class="theme-1">
<p>When Bitcoin and Ethereum fees rise, many people seek more affordable ways to move their crypto. Bitcoin's average transaction cost is currently around $2.35 and Ethereum's gas fees are about $0.75. Fees tend to skyrocket during periods of high demand which usually happens during a bull run. It's also worth remembering that the fees exchanges charge for withdrawals are a separate cost from these network fees and can vary widely. This guide spotlights leading Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, all from the top 100 by market value, that are built for exceptionally low transaction costs.</p>
<p>Here are cryptocurrencies that offer lowest transaction fees:</p>
<h2>1. <a href="https://kaspa.org/">Kaspa</a> (KAS): $0.000010 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gccLQER.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Kaspa transaction fee">
<p>Kaspa offers exceptionally low fees. It is a Proof of Work cryptocurrency that utilizes a novel BlockDAG structure, differing from a traditional blockchain. This design facilitates parallel block processing, leading to very fast block times of 0.1 seconds. As a decentralized network, Kaspa aims for high throughput, security and scalability, positioning itself as a leading choice for speed and cost-efficiency.</p>
<h2>2. <a href="https://www.soniclabs.com/">Sonic</a> (S): $0.000424 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E4UU56N.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Sonic transaction fee">
<p>Sonic is a Layer-1 blockchain compatible with EVM. It uses a Proof of Stake consensus and integrates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for efficiency. Its block times are 0.51 seconds. This combination of technologies supports quick processing and competitive transaction costs on the network.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> (LTC): $0.0012 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wj5XNLh.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Litecoin transaction fee">
<p>Litecoin is a Bitcoin fork that uses a traditional Proof of Work blockchain. Often considered a testing ground for Bitcoin-related innovations, Litecoin has implemented several features ahead of Bitcoin, though not all are intended for Bitcoin itself. To improve speed, Litecoin reduced block times to 2.5 minutes, enabling faster transaction confirmations. It remains a highly adopted and considerably cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. Recently, Litecoin also introduced an optional privacy feature, enhancing user confidentiality.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/">Internet Computer</a> (ICP): $0.00056 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PfUVcuP.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Internet Computer transaction fee">
<p>The Internet Computer provides very low transaction costs. Its blockchain architecture uses blocks and epochs, incorporating a Proof of Stake based system and sharding to scale throughput. Block times are 0.48 seconds. ICP developers can cover fees by loading "cycles" into their canisters, often resulting in no cost for end-users interacting with applications.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en">BNB Chain</a> (BNB): $0.0016 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bvuQZl2.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="BNB Chain transaction fee">
<p>BNB Chain is a blockchain that uses a Proof of Staked Authority consensus mechanism, combining elements of PoS and PoA. With block times as fast as 0.75 seconds, it enables quick transaction finality. Its low fees and high throughput make it a cost-effective option for many applications, supporting a broad ecosystem of DeFi and dApps while efficiently handling high volumes.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://bch.info/en/">Bitcoin Cash</a> (BCH): $0.0024 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/72OnsAw.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Bitcoin Cash transaction fee">
<p>Bitcoin Cash is another fork of Bitcoin that aims to function as digital cash, featuring larger block sizes to support more transactions. It uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism with typical block times of around 10 minutes. While it is slower than many newer networks, Bitcoin Cash offers low transaction fees and focuses on peer-to-peer payments, making it well-suited for cross-border transfers, online purchases, and situations where fast settlement isn't critical.</p>
<h2>7. <a href="https://sui.io/">SUI</a> (SUI): $0.0027 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LPQgijN.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="SUI transaction fee">
<p>SUI implements a Move-based blockchain that also uses a DAG structure. It operates on a Proof of Stake consensus. This design enhances transaction efficiency. Its block times are 0.24 seconds, allowing for quick processing. SUI focuses on fast settlement and performance for web3 applications.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://www.sei.io/">SEI</a> (SEI): $0.003 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iJsrZ0x.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="SEI transaction fee">
<p>SEI is a Cosmos SDK blockchain built with Tendermint, operating on a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus. It prioritizes speed and efficiency. Its block times are 0.5 seconds, ensuring rapid transaction processing. It is optimized for trading applications that demand high throughput.</p>
<h2>9. <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> (ATOM): $0.00333 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lMRRbhC.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Cosmos transaction fee">
<p>Cosmos is the core of a blockchain ecosystem, utilizing a Tendermint Proof of Stake consensus. It emphasizes interoperability, enabling communication between different blockchains. Its block times are 6 seconds. This project aims to establish an "Internet of Blockchains" for seamless asset and data transfer.</p>
<h2>10. <a href="https://ton.org/">Toncoin</a> (TON): $0.0076 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/94y8pDA.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="The Open Network transaction fee">
<p>Toncoin is a blockchain built on a modified Proof of Stake consensus with Byzantine fault tolerance. It uses sharding to scale throughput and has block times of around 5 seconds. This allows for efficient and relatively low-cost transactions, making Toncoin practical for various uses - especially within its ecosystem connected to Telegram, where it aims to drive widespread adoption.</p>
<h3>List Explained</h3>
<p>This list exclusively features cryptocurrencies within the top 100 by market capitalization. This ensures a meaningful comparison among actively used and established networks, avoiding misleading scenarios where fees might appear minimal simply due to very low activity or niche usage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we excluded coins that typically require a wallet creation or activation fee, or mandate a minimum balance for holding or transacting. While such coins may present low per-transaction fees, the initial or recurring costs associated with wallet setup often surpass the expense of a single transaction. Examples of cryptocurrencies omitted for these reasons include XRP, Stellar, Algorand, Solana, and Polkadot.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
<p>Nano, a feeless cryptocurrency, allows transactions without fees but faces occasional spam attacks and network congestion, impacting its reliability. Qubic, another feeless platform, aims to revolutionize blockchain but remains unproven and lacks battle-testing. Digibyte offers low fees but sees limited activity, making it less relevant for users seeking high-activity networks. XELIS, with its BlockDAG architecture and privacy-focused homomorphic encryption, shows promise but is new, with limited information about its core team, placing it outside more established projects.</p>
