<p>When Bitcoin and Ethereum fees rise, many people seek more affordable ways to move their crypto. Bitcoin's average transaction cost is currently around $1.36, and Ethereum's gas fees are about $0.75. It's also worth remembering that the fees exchanges charge for withdrawals are a separate cost from these network fees and can vary widely. This guide spotlights leading Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, all from the top 100 by market value, that are built for exceptionally low transaction costs.</p>
<p>Here are cryptocurrencies that offer lowest transaction fees:</p>
<h2>1. <a href="https://kaspa.org/">Kaspa</a> (KAS): $0.000010 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gccLQER.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Kaspa transaction fee">
<p>Kaspa offers exceptionally low fees. It is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency that utilizes a novel BlockDAG structure, differing from a traditional blockchain. This design facilitates parallel block processing, leading to very fast block times of 0.1 seconds. As a decentralized network, Kaspa aims for high throughput and scalability, positioning itself as a leading choice for speed and cost-efficiency.</p>
<h2>2. <a href="https://www.soniclabs.com/">Sonic</a> (S): $0.000424 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E4UU56N.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Sonic transaction fee">
<p>Sonic is a Layer-1 blockchain compatible with EVM. It uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus and integrates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for efficiency. Its block times are 0.51 seconds. This combination of technologies supports quick processing and competitive transaction costs on the network.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> (LTC): $0.0012 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wj5XNLh.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Litecoin transaction fee">
<p>Litecoin is a Bitcoin fork that employs a standard Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain. Its block times are 2.5 minutes, which is longer than newer chains.

<h2>4. <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/">Internet Computer</a> (ICP): $0.00056 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PfUVcuP.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Internet Computer transaction fee">
<p>The Internet Computer provides very low transaction costs. Its blockchain architecture uses blocks and epochs, incorporating a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based system and sharding to scale throughput. Block times are 0.48 seconds. ICP developers can cover fees by loading "cycles" into their canisters, often resulting in no cost for end-users interacting with applications.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en">BNB Chain</a> (BNB): $0.0016 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bvuQZl2.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="BNB Chain transaction fee">
<p>BNB Chain is a blockchain utilizing a Proof-of-Staked-Authority (PoSA) consensus, a hybrid of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Authority. Its block times, at just 0.75 seconds, make it a cost-effective option for many applications and transactions. It supports a broad ecosystem of DeFi and dApps, handling high volumes efficiently.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://bch.info/en/">Bitcoin Cash</a> (BCH): $0.0023 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/72OnsAw.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Bitcoin Cash transaction fee">

Its block times are 0.24 seconds, allowing for quick processing. SUI focuses on fast settlement and performance for web3 applications.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://www.sei.io/">SEI</a> (SEI): $0.0029 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PinVN3y.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="SEI transaction fee">

<h2>9. <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> (ATOM): $0.00333 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lMRRbhC.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="Cosmos transaction fee">
<p>Cosmos is the core of a blockchain ecosystem, utilizing a Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. It emphasizes interoperability, enabling communication between different blockchains. Its block times are 6 seconds. This project aims to establish an "Internet of Blockchains" for seamless asset and data transfer.</p>
<h2>10. <a href="https://ton.org/">Toncoin</a> (TON): $0.0076 fee</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/94y8pDA.jpeg" style="height: 70px;" alt="The Open Network transaction fee">
<p>Toncoin is built as a blockchain using a modified Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus with Byzantine fault tolerance. It utilizes sharding to scale throughput. Its block times are 5 seconds. This makes it a relatively affordable option for various uses, particularly within its ecosystem linked to Telegram, aiming for widespread adoption.</p>
<h3>List Explained</h3>
<p>This list exclusively features cryptocurrencies within the top 100 by market capitalization. This ensures a meaningful comparison among actively used and established networks, avoiding misleading scenarios where fees might appear minimal simply due to very low activity or niche usage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we excluded coins that typically require a wallet creation or activation fee, or mandate a minimum balance for holding or transacting. While such coins may present low per-transaction fees, the initial or recurring costs associated with wallet setup often surpass the expense of a single transaction. Examples of cryptocurrencies omitted for these reasons include XRP, Stellar, Algorand, Solana, and Polkadot.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
<p>Nano, a feeless cryptocurrency, allows transactions without fees but faces occasional spam attacks and network congestion, impacting its reliability. Qubic, another feeless platform, aims to revolutionize blockchain but remains unproven and lacks battle-testing. Digibyte offers low fees but sees limited activity, making it less relevant for users seeking high-activity networks. XELIS, with its BlockDAG architecture and privacy-focused homomorphic encryption, shows promise but is new, with limited information about its core team, placing it outside more established projects.</p>
