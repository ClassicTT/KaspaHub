	<h2 class="card-title">Top 10 Cryptocurrencies With Their High Transaction Speeds</h2>
	<article>
	<p>In today's fast-paced digital world, the demand for instant information and rapid transactions continues to grow. This need is especially true in the cryptocurrency space. Here, the speed at which a blockchain network can process and confirm transactions is a key factor. Whether you are using decentralized applications (dApps), engaging in active trading, or facilitating large-scale enterprise solutions, swift transaction processing is essential for a smooth and efficient experience. But how do we measure this speed, and which Layer 1 cryptocurrencies are currently leading the way in high transaction throughput?</p>
	<section>
	<h2>Understanding Block Time</h2>
	<p>Block time is the average time it takes for a new block of transactions to be added to the ledger. Shorter block times usually mean faster confirmations, faster time to finality, and the ability to handle more transactions per second, leading to higher overall throughput.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h2>The Blockchain Trilemma: A Core Challenge</h2>
	<p>Developers have long faced the "blockchain trilemma". This idea, from Vitalik Buterin, says it's hard for a blockchain to be fully secure, scalable, and decentralized all at once. Many projects choose two out of three, often trading decentralization or security for speed. For example, some solutions rely on sharding, which divides the blockchain into smaller, more manageable pieces. While sharding can boost transaction capacity, it's also known to introduce security tradeoffs and can slow down the overall finality time of transactions across the entire network.</p>

	<h2>Top Layer 1 Cryptocurrencies by Block Time</h2>
	<p>Here are some of the fastest Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, mostly ranked by their block times. We pulled this data from chainspect.app and other good sources. These show the tech that makes them fast:</p>

	<h3>Block Time</h3>
	<p>Block time is the average duration required to append a new block to the ledger. Shorter block times allow for faster transaction confirmations, enhancing the user experience for payments and applications. Cryptocurrencies vary in their approach, with some achieving sub-second block times for speed, while others opt for slower block times and larger block sizes to improve throughput, which can introduce potential security and performance issues.</p>
	<h3>Max TPS</h3>
	<p>Maximum Transactions Per Second (TPS) measures a network’s capacity to process transactions. High TPS is critical for scalability, supporting widespread adoption and real-time applications like payments or DeFi. Traditional blockchains often face bottlenecks due to linear block processing, whereas advanced structures like BlockDAGs or layer-2 solutions can handle thousands of TPS, enabling efficient, high-throughput ecosystems. Most TPS data sourced from Chainspect.</p>
	<h3>Transaction Fees</h3>
	<p>Transaction fees are costs users pay to process transactions, serving to prevent spam by discouraging frivolous activity and to incentivize miners, stakers or node runners to validate and secure the network. Low fees enhance accessibility for microtransactions, especially in high-throughput systems. Fee structures vary by network design, consensus type, and demand, with some offering near-zero costs through optimized processing, while others face higher fees due to computational demands or market-driven pricing.</p>
	<h3>Consensus Mechanisms</h3>
	<p>Consensus mechanisms determine how a network validates transactions. Proof of Work (PoW) uses computational power to ensure robust security through decentralized mining. Proof of Stake (PoS) relies on staked assets to select validators, which may concentrate control among large stakeholders. Both mechanisms balance security, speed, and decentralization with distinct trade-offs.</p>
	<h3>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)</h3>
	<p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) defines the structure of a cryptocurrency’s ledger. Traditional blockchains process transactions sequentially, limiting throughput. Advanced DLTs, like BlockDAGs or Block-Lattices, allow parallel transaction processing, significantly boosting scalability while maintaining security. The choice of DLT impacts a network’s ability to handle high transaction volumes and adapt to diverse use cases.</p>
	<h3>Security</h3>
	<p>Security in cryptocurrencies ensures resistance to attacks like double-spending, 51% attacks and spam. High security often stems from decentralized mining (PoW) or robust validator networks (PoS). However, trade-offs exist: highly centralized systems may sacrifice security for speed, while computationally intensive systems prioritize integrity over efficiency. Advanced designs mitigate these risks through innovative structures like GHOSTDAG.</p>
